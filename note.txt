Dear TA:
ONE student of our original group(3 members) dropped out this course. 
(Hongxi Zhang 101037604)‚ùå

For this case, our professor suggested me to add a notification to explain the incident.
Our two remaining team members will try our best to complete our project.
But the UI part and the algorithm part of calculating Sudoku may not be perfect.
And the final product interface may base on terminal control instead of a mature software / interactive interface.

Thanks for your understand.
Zhangwen Yan, Hanbo Zhang
